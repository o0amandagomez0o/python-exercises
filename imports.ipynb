    "# Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We **import** libraries and modules into our current python environment or session in order to use the the functions, methods, or code within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can only **import** what has already been **installed**! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages, Libaries & Modules, Oh My!\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Module** is a Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables. It is an executable file with a .py extension. A module can exist in: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Base python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Community developed packages (https://pypi.org/), \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your working directory as a file that you have created. For example, Darden student Bethany Thompson has a repository named 'Predicting-Diabetes-Onset' (https://github.com/ThompsonBethany01/Predicting-Diabetes-Onset). It contains a file named Prepare.py, which is a module she created that she imports in her 'Data_Analysis.ipynb' Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Package** is a directory having collections of modules. It can also consist of other packages, or 'sub-packages'. It is a way to distribute one or more modules. We *install* packages in order to be able to *import* modules or libraries for use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python Package Index (PyPI, https://pypi.org/) is a repository of community developed Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda's **Conda** product is a package manager. It helps you find and install packages (that originate in PyPI). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Library** is \"a collection of related functionality of codes that allows you to perform many tasks without writing your code. It is a reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it in our program.\" [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-pythons-module-package-and-library/) Next week, we will introduce you to the most awesome library ever ;)...Pandas. In fact, Pandas is a module, a library AND a package. https://pandas.pydata.org/. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install to Import\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to import a library or a module we have to install a package that contains it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The basic Python installation includes a set of standard modules. The list and details can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Base installation of Anaconda includes a set of packages containing additional libraries and modules (beyond the base Python). The list of all available packages can be found at the link below, and the ones included in the base installation are indicated by a check mark in the 'In Installer' column. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.7_osx-64/. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You run commands to install packages from your terminal, outside of a python session. You run commands to import modules & libraries within a python environment (after starting Python from the terminal, in a jupyter notebook, or within a python file). \n",
    "\n",
    "- To install packages that contain modules not included in the base installation of Python or Anaconda, you can go directly through PyPI using the following command in your terminal: *pip install <package_name>* (PiP = Package in Python) OR through Anaconda's Package Manager, Conda, using *conda install <package_name>*. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is best to try installing via conda first, as Anaconda vets the packages available for safety and reliability. On the other hand, PyPI is commumity developed, so it is very easy for malicious code to be contributed and exist for a bit before it is caught and pulled down. Because of that, it is important to pay close attention to what you are installing. Check the followers, supports, downloads of a package before you install it. You don't want to install a package that is new or not well known, unless you have fully vetted the code and know what it is doing. To see the code, you can visit the github repo for each package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To compare conda and pip commands, check out this table: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html#conda-vs-pip-vs-virtualenv-commands\n",

    "**Practice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the bokeh package using `conda install bokeh`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install Zach's Python Utilities package using `pip install zgulde` https://pypi.org/project/zgulde/\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install pydataset. Try using `conda install pydataset`. What happens? Google 'Install pydataset'. Check out the first search result! So, how can you install it? Go ahead and install it. "
