# 
# ### 1. Conditional Basics
# 
# - a. prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is Monday or not

# In[1]:


today = input("What day of the week is today?")

if "Mon" in today:
    print ("Got a case of the Monday's")
else:
    print("TGI-NOT-M!")
print("Let's git some!")


# - b. prompt the user for a day of the week, print out whether the day is a weekday or a weekend

# In[4]:


today = input("What day of the week is today?")
today = today.capitalize()
weekdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
weekends = ["Saturday", "Sunday"]

if today in weekdays:
    print ("Today is a weekdayâ€¦ ðŸ’»")
elif today in weekends:
    print ("We're in the weekend! ðŸŒˆ")
else:
    print("You may want to check your spelling.")


# - c. create variables and make up values for
#     - c.1 the number of hours worked in one week
#     - c.2 the hourly rate
#     - c.3 how much the week's paycheck will be

# In[5]:


hoursworked = 40
payrate = 25.50
paycheck = hoursworked * payrate

paycheck


# In[8]:


# clean up answer
hoursworked = 40
payrate = 25.50
paycheck = hoursworked * payrate

f"${paycheck:.2f} will be your total pay for this week"


#    - d. write the python code that calculates the weekly paycheck. You get paid time and a half if you work more than 40 hours
# 

# In[9]:


hrs = 43
rate = 25.5
regpay = hrs * rate
otpay = (rate * 40) + ((hrs-40) * (1.5 * rate))

if hrs > 40:
    print (otpay)
else:
    print (regpay)
    


# ### 2. Loop Basics
# 
# - a. While
# 
#      - a.1 Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
#      - a.2 Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
#      - a.3 Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.

# In[12]:


i = 5
while i <= 15:
    print (i)
    i += 1


#    - a.4 Create a while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.

# In[13]:


# standard convention to use variable i for iterations
i = 0
while i <= 100:
    print (i)
    i += 2


# - a.5 Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.

# In[14]:


i = 100
while i >= -10:
    print (i)
    i -= 5


# - a.6 Create a while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 1,000,000. Output should equal:

# In[18]:


i = 2
while i <= 1000000:
    print (i ** 2)
    i += 1
    


# In[21]:


i = 2

while i <= 1000000:
    print (i)
    i = i ** 2


# In[ ]:


i = 2

while i <= 1_000_000
    print(i)
    i *= i
   # i = i*i
   # i **=2


# - a.7 Write a loop that uses print to create the output shown below.
#     - list backwards by 5's from 100 to 5.

# In[25]:


i = 100
while i >= 5:
    print (i)
    i -= 5
    


# - b. For Loops
# 
#     - b.1 Write some code that prompts the user for a number, then shows a multiplication table up through 10 for that number.
# 

# In[34]:


# convert str to int
user_no = int(input("Type a number."))
#stop in range is exclusive
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{user_no} x {i} = {user_no * i}")
    # newer version of str formatting


# In[35]:


# older version of str formatting
user_no = int(input("Type a number."))

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(user_no, "x", i, "=", user_no*i)


# In[30]:


# testing for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
    print (i)


# In[33]:


# testing w/o input
user_no = 2

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(user_no, "x", i, "=", user_no*i)


# - b.2 Create a for loop that uses print to create the output shown below.
#     - takes a number starting at 1( to 9) and prints the numeral the amt of times the number is.
# 
# 
# 

# In[36]:


# me trying to math it out: it didn't work
for num in range(1, 10):
    print(num * (11 ** (num - 1)))


# In[37]:


#convert int to str 
for num in range(1, 10):
    print(str(num) * num)


# - c. break and continue
# 
# - c.1 Prompt the user for an odd number between 1 and 50. Use a loop and a break statement to continue prompting the user if they enter invalid input. (Hint: use the isdigit method on strings to determine this). Use a loop and the continue statement to output all the odd numbers between 1 and 50, except for the number the user entered.

# In[58]:


# print all odd's and skips the input number
digit = int(input("Type an odd number between 1 - 50."))

        continue

# takes data type into account and returns message if
#input is not a number but a str

# - d. The input function can be used to prompt for input and use that input in your python code. Prompt the user to enter a positive number and write a loop that counts from 0 to that number. (Hints: first make sure that the value the user entered is a valid number, also note that the input function returns a string, so you'll need to convert this to a numeric type.)

# 1. continuously 
#     1. prompt the user for a positive #
#     2. check if the input is composed of digits, if so:
#         1. convert to a numeric type
#         1. check if the number is negative or 0, if so:
#             1. go back to square one
#         1. stop the loop (`break`)

# ### 3. Fizzbuzz
# 
# One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to test basic looping and conditional logic skills.
# 
# - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# - For the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# ### 4. Display a table of powers.
# 
# - Prompt the user to enter an integer.
# - Display a table of squares and cubes from 1 to the value entered.
# - Ask if the user wants to continue.
# - Assume that the user will enter valid data.
# - Only continue if the user agrees to.

# ### 5. Convert given number grades into letter grades.
# 
# - Prompt the user for a numerical grade from 0 to 100.
# - Display the corresponding letter grade.
# - Prompt the user to continue.
# - Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the grades.
# - The application should only continue if the user agrees to.
